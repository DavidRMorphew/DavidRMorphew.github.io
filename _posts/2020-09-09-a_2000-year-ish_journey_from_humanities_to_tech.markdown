My background is in teaching Classical Greek, Latin, and about the ancient world. 

There's still a lot of work to be done in the digital humanities, and I've spent some time on a project that makes ancient astronomical texts accessible (in English translations) with an interactive website. But, more than updating access to and enhancing work with ancient texts, I'm excited about all the new avenues for creative design that software engineering opens up. I'm particularly excited about designing applications that have real-world use.

In short, I'm looking forward to moving into the 21st century and learning new languages for programming!
